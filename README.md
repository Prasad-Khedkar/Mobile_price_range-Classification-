# Mobile_price_range-Classification-

## Project Desciption :
##### In the competitive phone market, companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. We will see how different features of mobile phone(e.g., RAM, Storage etc) are related to its price.

#### In this classification problem, the main objective is not to predict the actual price(value) of mobile but to classify(categorise the price) it's price into 4 categories, namely- 0(Low cost), 1(Moderate cost), 2(High cost), 3(Expensive)


## Approach taken:
##### Data Loading
##### Data cleaning
##### EDA
##### Data Preparation(Feature and Label Selection)
##### Different Model Implementations
##### Final Model Selection
##### Tuning the final model

## Conclusions :

##### Logistic Regression algorithm performed well and upon tuning it's hyper-parameters, it classified the price range correctly upto 90%+ score on both train & test set
